I will periodically copy my code from my machine and paste it into an email and send it back to myself. While at work, I'll copy the email and paste into a repl (I do not take my personal machine to work) and work on it. Once I'm done at work I'll email it back to myself completed with updates and then put it in my VSCode when I get home. Once it is in VSCode I have to spend a small period of time debugging becasue repl is a very forgiving program.
