<!-- User Stories
User stories are a device commonly used in software development to identify what the functionality and design of a product should be by considering the interests and motivations of people with varied multiple points of view. They are presented in the manner of

As a __, I want __, so that __

This layout allows a client to communicate to a team what type of behavior they are looking for and allow the developer team to think up a solution that best fits the clients need.

The development team will then create sub-bullets called Feature Tasks which are individual tasks that must be completed by the developer to accomplish the user story. Once all of the feature tasks for an individual user story is completed, so is the story.

Below are your lab requirements in this format. Try and think up what the feature tasks would be for each story, once your done, or you get stuck, review the provided feature tasks to see what the actual tasks are for each story. -->



<!-- Instructions
As a user, I would like to display three unique products by chance so that the viewers can pick a favorite.

Create a constructor function that creates an object associated with each product, and has the following properties:
Name of the product
File path of image
Create an algorithm that will randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.

Attach an event listener to the section of the HTML page where the images are going to be displayed.

Once the users ‘clicks’ a product, generate three new products for the user to pick from.
As a user, I would like to track the selections made by viewers so that I can determine which products to keep for the catalog.
In the constructor function define a property to hold the number of times a product has been clicked.

After every selection by the viewer, update the newly added property to reflect if it was clicked.

As a user, I would like to control the number of rounds a user is presented with so that I can control the voting session duration.
By default, the user should be presented with 25 rounds of voting before ending the session.
Keep the number of rounds in a variable to allow the number to be easily changed for debugging and testing purposes.
As a user, I would like to view a report of results after all rounds of voting have concluded so that I can evaluate which products were the most popular.
Create a property attached to the constructor function itself that keeps track of all the products that are currently being considered.

After voting rounds have been completed, remove the event listeners on the product.

Display the list of all the products followed by the votes received and number of times seen for each. Example: Banana Slicer had 3 votes and was shown 5 times -->



<!-- Stretch Goals
Handle the display and voting for an arbitrary number of images
Using a variable, declare in your JS how many images to show.
Based on that value, dynamically create that many <img> tags
Also based on that value, ensure that your randomizer is properly handling the specified number of images for display and repeat tracking.
Resources
The assets for this lab can be found in your class11/lab/assets folder of your daily class repo.

Provided in your class repo is a suggested wireframe to follow while building out your BusMall application. -->

<!-- Developer Style Guide
Create a new repo for this weekly project called bus-mall at the root level of your labs directory.

Scaffold your repo with the usual README, CSS, JS, and HTML files, plus a img/ directory.

Include in your repository a .eslintrc.json file whose contents are copied from the eslintrc.json file in the class repository.

Retrieve the assets from the assets/ directory and place them in your image directory.

Do today’s work on a branch called lab11-busmall.

This is an individual assignment today, but you are free to collaborate with classmates if you want. Just be sure that if you do, be sure to make note of that collaboration in your README file. -->
